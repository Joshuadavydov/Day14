Even though algorithms have a lot of positive aspects, they can reinforce existing biases if they rely on biased data. These bias can skew results towards a certain way."

    "\n",
    "These articles discuss the ethical challenges and biases present in AI. They talk about how even though AI has a lot of benefits, it can unintentionally reinforce harmful biases due to the data they learn from and the programming choices made by developers. Since white men are mainly building AI, the data that is being imputed for the AI to learn from is skewed toward the bias present in our society, even if it is done unintentionally. This is problematic since AI is starting to be used in the real world, like in hiring, policing, and many careers, often leading to unfair outcomes for marginalized communities. Since AI has many uses, this is urging that AI be developed with ethical frameworks to prevent discrimination and promote fairness. One way to create unbiased AI is to ensure that a diverse group of people are working on making the AI to ensure that the data being imputed in AI is unbiased.\n",

    "3. Discuss your own reaction to the book/article. Did it have any effect on how you think about data and ethics? Do you agree with the author? What specific ideas really stood out to you?\n",
    "\n",
    "It was intersting to realize how easily biases can be built into algorithms, especially considering that these technologies are often perceived as neutral or objective. Also I agree with the authors that while AI has potential, there’s an need for fixing the bias within algorithms. For example one of the articles talks about the google empoyees that tried to adress the issue but ended up being fired from google. This shows that there needs to be more attention brought to this issue."
